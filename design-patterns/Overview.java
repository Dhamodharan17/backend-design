  /*
 Creational
1.Singleton - only one object of the class e.g db connection object
2.Factory - there will be factory class which creates object based on the given object
3.Abstact Factory - factory that will creates family of object (related objects)
4..buillder - helps create object [ avoid multiple unused constrcutor(director->create objects with default values)
5.prototype -when object creation is heavy (clonable) [registry - hashmap]

Structural - helps to structure our application
1.Adapter - converting one object into another
2.Bridge - convert "IS a" to "Has a"
3.Decorter - add behaviour of one object into special wrapper[ base class+different decortors]
4.facade - whenever working with 3rd party library, we want only part of library 
5.Proxy - before calling object add another layer with buisness logic
6.composite - will handle the add,remove and print and it is like manager(hirercy of classes)

Behavorial 
1. Chain of responsibility - passing data from one logic to another
2. command -don't directly execute request on buisness logic, execute command that will execure buiness logic
3.Iterator - allows us to traverse all of the data strcuture
4.mediator - b/w different object and behavior and reduces dependcies
5.observer - when there is change all the subscribers will be altered
6.flyweight -object creation process is heavy, it helps to utlize existing object with intrisctic properties
7.interpretor - expresion matching
8.memento - when we want to store state of a object and restore object
9.state design pattern - instead of if else, based on contect, action will taken
10.template - define set of instrcution that need to be folloes and make client to change some instruction
11.startegy - instead of if else, we reach stategy will execure different algorthim
